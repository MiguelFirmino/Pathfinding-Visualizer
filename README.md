# Pathfinding Visualizer🏴

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular. With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular. 
Not only that, but I aim to completely overhaul my former <a href="https://github.com/MiguelFirmino/Dijkstra-Visualizer/tree/master">Dijkstra Visualizer</a> 
project to a better, optimized, more professional version by applying Angular's powerful tools.

## 🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

🚩 Done: 🚩
1) added header, node-map and node components.
2) implemented Dijkstra, A* and Depth First Search algorithms!
3) created service for generating node-map.
4) configured rendering and basic styling for node-map's nodes.
5) add caption/legend for each color on the screen.
6) added diagonals!

🚩 To do: 🚩
1) implement starting conditions.

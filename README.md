# Pathfinding Visualizer

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular.
With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular.

## Work in progress!

-- Done --
1) added header, node-map and node components.
2) created service for generating node-map.
3) configured rendering and basic styling for node-map's nodes.

-- Due --
1) configure logic for node.neighbour attribute.
2) improve visualization of nodes by the use of colors/descriptions.
3) add caption/legend for each color on the screen.
4) create service for actual pathfinding algorithm.

# Pathfinding Visualizer🏴

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular. With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular. 
Not only that, but I aim to completely overhaul my former <a href="https://github.com/MiguelFirmino/Dijkstra-Visualizer/tree/master">Dijkstra Visualizer</a> 
project to a better, optimized, more professional version by applying Angular's powerful tools.

## 🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

🚩 Done: 🚩
1) implemented Dijkstra, A* and Depth First Search.
2) implemented map controlling.
3) implemented instantaneous visualization.
4) implemented basic animations and node styling.
5) implemented map creation and clearing.
6) implemented click/drag dynamic controlling.

🚩 To do: 🚩
1) improve instantaneous visualization.
2) improve node animations.
3) add bidirectional swarm algorithm.
4) many more!
5) add bootstrap css.
6) implement lazy rendering of node-map.
7) figure out a way to modularize node-map-component.ts
8) improve readability of everything.
9) figure out a way to resize the node map dinamically.
10) add a results section (iteration count, time spent).
11) add preview images 📷
12) many more!

🚩 Maybe: 🚩
1) implement simultaneous algorithm comparing!
2) ideas are still brewing!

# Pathfinding Visualizer🏴

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular. With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular. 
Not only that, but I aim to completely overhaul my former <a href="https://github.com/MiguelFirmino/Dijkstra-Visualizer/tree/master">Dijkstra Visualizer</a> 
project to a better, optimized, more professional version by applying Angular's powerful tools.

## 🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

🚩 Done: 🚩

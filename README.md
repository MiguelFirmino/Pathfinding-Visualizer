# Pathfinding Visualizer🏴

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular. With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular. 
Not only that, but I aim to completely overhaul my former <a href="https://github.com/MiguelFirmino/Dijkstra-Visualizer/tree/master">Dijkstra Visualizer</a> 
project to a better, optimized, more professional version by applying Angular's powerful tools.

## 🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

🚩 Done: 🚩
1) added header, node-map and node components.
2) create service for actual pathfinding algorithm!
3) created service for A* algorithm!
4) created service for generating node-map.
5) configured rendering and basic styling for node-map's nodes.
6) add caption/legend for each color on the screen.
7) added diagonals!

🚩 To do: 🚩
1) implement start conditions.
2) many more!

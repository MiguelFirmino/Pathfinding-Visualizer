# Pathfinding Visualizer

A pathfinding algorithm visualizer built on Angular.
With this project, my goal is to majorly improve my skills and knowledge on Angular. Not only that, but I aim to completely overhaul my former <a href="https://github.com/MiguelFirmino/Dijkstra-Visualizer/tree/master">Dijkstra Visualizer</a> project to a better, optimized, more professional version by applying Angular's powerful tools.

## 🚧 Work in progress! 🚧

🚩 Done: 🚩
1) added header, node-map and node components.
2) created service for generating node-map.
3) configured rendering and basic styling for node-map's nodes.

🚩 To do: 🚩
1) configure logic for node.neighbour attribute.
2) improve visualization of nodes by the use of colors/descriptions.
3) add caption/legend for each color on the screen.
4) create service for actual pathfinding algorithm.
